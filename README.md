# Tiki-Web-Scraping
My first web scraping project was done as a weekly project for Machine Learning bootcamp at CoderSchool.

Requirement: Build a web-crawler that take in a Tiki URL, an e-commerce website, and return a dataframe that contains following products' information: Name, Price, Thumbnail URL, Product Page URL, Product Rating, Tiki Now, Freeship, Under_Price, Discount, Installment and Gift across all product categories.

Scraping software chosen was Selenium. For more of what Selenium can do (beyond the scope of this project), please visit: https://www.selenium.dev/. Warning: new Selenium version if installed may result in some syntax depreciated thus requires appropriate revision.
